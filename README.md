# Identifying-Hot-Leads-using-Logistic-Regression
rom 30% to 80% conversion rate!!!

The Business problem was they were getting good amount of leads but conversion rate was mere 30%.

They wanted to focus on leads that can be easily converted, thus, improving the conversion rate and also making the sales team's routine more efficient.

BUT

They don't know who is a hot lead and who is not.

So, they relied on the data and the ask was to get a minimum 80% conversion rate from the languishing number at 30%

I used logistic regression to determine the probability of which lead would be worth calling. 

From the probability cutoff chart (bottom left) we can see that the intersection point is at 0.36. Anything below this is not worth spending time and anything above this is worth calling.
